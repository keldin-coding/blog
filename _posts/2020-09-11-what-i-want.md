# Where is Home?

I've been working through therapy for a while now. Two common themes recur: I simultaneously hate myself and have no idea who I am or what I want in life. While the first is a very long road to tread, I can try to figure out what a Good Life looks like for me.

One of the things I keep thinking about is where to put down roots; where might I want to buy a home and live for a long time rather than a couple of years. I really liked living in Kansas City, MO: it's far enough from my family to be annoying for them to show up but close enough I can go back for an emergency or a weekend, the community is pleasant, lovely architecture, an almost-liberal hold in a very conservative state. Seattle, WA was also great: beautiful surroundings, liberal hold in a kinda blue state (we'll get back to that), lovely architecture if you know where to look.

For the past six months or so, I've been living in the Tri-Cities, WA. It's a different kind of place. There's some of Washington's nature ideals. It's a desert so it's gorgeous in a way that's very different from the lush forests and mountains of Seattle. It's also very new, which is something I didn't expect to...not appeal to me in the same way. While a lot of construction in Seattle is very new, Seattle itself is old (for America). It was a large city before the 20th century, burned down, and rebuilt with some uniqueness. The Tri-Cities isn't that. There's a bit of history, but settlement here doesn't really pick up until early-to-mid 20th century with the Manhattan Project and its aftermath really driving population. It's also a pretty conservative area, something I struggle with quite frankly. And, it's far from my family.

When I was a high schooler, I looked at a few places to go to college: Washington University of St. Louis, University of Arkansas (where I went), University of Missouri - Kansas City, University of Washington, and University of Minnesota. These were the five I cared most about looking through and understanding. I landed at Arkansas because it was 4 hours away from most of my family and was a new start. UMKC as similarly a new start. I moved to Seattle at 24 and was there until I was 28, moving to the Tri-Cities. These have always been the places I looked to most, with job opportunities driving me from place to place.

COVID-19, for all it's terribleness especially in the States, has shown me I can work pretty well remotely, though. I've learned new ways of collaborating and self-motivating. Admittedly, I miss the office; I miss the simple camaraderie of bumping into people, the socialization and knowing you can go out with them after work and it's a way to build friendships. But the remoteness has shown I could in theory live and work almost anywhere.

Minneapolis keeps tickling at the back of my mind as a place to set down roots, a place to go. It's the Midwest, so I'd be pretty used to whatever it can throw, though certainly more harsh winters than KCMO or my hometown offered. The architecture is what I know and love. Minneapolis is also a fairly liberal city with Minnesota being a somewhat liberal state. I think it's a place I could maybe call home?

I'm not sure. I wouldn't know anyone there, and I love my friends I've made in Washington. I'm drawn to them; I love them. I don't know if I could actually start basically over again, at least for people to do casual dinners with or to grab a drink.

But it's a thing I'm thinking about as I get to a point where I'd like to dig roots in deep in a place I want to call home.
